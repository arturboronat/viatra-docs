The VIATRA website describes where to download VIATRA from: https://www.eclipse.org/viatra/downloads.php This tutorial was written for version 1.4 (released on 30th September 2016).

For a faster installation, you may deselect the _Contact all update sites during install\..._ field, but then it is necessary to install the required _Xtext SDK_ manually.

This tutorial relies on the CPS demonstrator example from https://git.eclipse.org/c/viatra/org.eclipse.viatra.examples.git/tree/cps (for a description of the example please consult https://github.com/viatra/viatra-docs/blob/master/cps/Home.adoc).

This document assumes that the metamodels themselves are installed into the Eclipse instance. They are available from the p2 repository https://build.incquerylabs.com/jenkins/job/CPS-Demonstrator/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/cps/releng/org.eclipse.viatra.examples.cps.update/target/repository/
