## Setting up the development environment

You can use link:https://www.eclipse.org/oomph[Oomph] to deploy a ready to go Eclipse IDE with the projects imported and all required dependencies already installed.

. *Product:* Most Eclipse products should work, but we recommend _Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers_
. *Project:* Check the _Eclipse Project/VIATRA/VIATRA CPS Demo_
. *Variables:*
  * Git password is required for link:http://eclipse.github.io/[Mylyn integration] to see tasks and pull requests, if you don't want that, just enter a whitespace.
  * For the repository URI, select Git only if you have a public key added to GitHub and the private key set up correctly.

Read the link:http://download.eclipse.org/oomph/help/org.eclipse.oomph.setup.doc/html/user/wizard/index.html[Oomph help] if you are lost in the wizard's forest.

## Creating new projects

* Copy one of the existing projects to make sure that all preferences are set correctly
* Don't forget to correctly rename the project and update the metadata
* Update the ```pom.xml``` in the new project (only the ```artifactId``` has to be changed at first)
* Add the new module to the parent ```pom.xml``` in the root of the repository
